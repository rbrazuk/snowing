## How to run

Make sure you've got Node installed, first and foremost - https://nodejs.org/en/

If so, in the project directory, run: `npm install` and then `npm start`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it!


Note - I'm currently using the CDN for FontAwesome during development, so you may get a whole bunch of CORS warnings/errors running the site locally. Fret not! There are Chrome and Firefox extensions that allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Firefox seems to behave without the extension, though.
